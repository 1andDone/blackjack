## Getting Started

### Setting up the Game

Create a `Blackjack` instance and configure the house rules to your liking.

```python
from blackjack.blackjack import Blackjack

blackjack = Blackjack(
    min_bet=10,
    max_bet=500,
    s17=True,
    blackjack_payout=1.5,
    max_hands=4,
    double_down=True,
    double_after_split=False,
    resplit_aces=False,
    insurance=True,
    late_surrender=True,
    dealer_shows_hole_card=False
)
```

### Creating Players

You can add different types of players to the game, each with unique behaviors and betting strategies.

#### Player

A `Player` uses basic strategy for every decision and always bets a fixed amount.

```python
from blackjack.player import Player

player = Player(
    name='Player',
    bankroll=1000000,
    min_bet=10
)
```

#### Card Counter

A `CardCounter` uses basic strategy in conjunction with a chosen card counting system. Bets vary based on the current running/true count.

```python
from blackjack.card_counter import CardCounter
from blackjack.enums import CardCountingSystem

card_counter = CardCounter(
    name='Card Counter',
    bankroll=50000,
    min_bet=10,
    card_counting_system=CardCountingSystem.HI_LO,
    bet_ramp={
        1: 10,
        2: 20,
        3: 40,
        4: 80,
        5: 150
    },
    insurance=None,
    training=True
)
```

#### Back Counter

A `BackCounter` is similar to a `CardCounter`, but they may join the table when the running/true count is favorable or leave it when it becomes unfavorable.

```python
from blackjack.back_counter import BackCounter
from blackjack.enums import CardCountingSystem

back_counter = BackCounter(
    name='Back Counter',
    bankroll=15000,
    min_bet=10,
    card_counting_system=CardCountingSystem.HI_LO,
    bet_ramp={
        1: 10,
        2: 20,
        3: 40,
        4: 80,
        5: 150
    },
    insurance=3,
    entry_point=2,
    exit_point=1,
    training=False
)
```

### Adding Players to the Table

Player's are dealt cards in the order that they are added.

```python
blackjack.add_player(player=player)
blackjack.add_player(player=card_counter)
blackjack.add_player(player=back_counter)
```

### Modes

#### Simulation Mode

Simulate a large number of shoes:

```python
blackjack.simulate(penetration=0.75, number_of_shoes=50000, shoe_size=8, seed=1)
```

#### Training Mode

Play individual rounds for practice:

```python
blackjack.training(penetration=0.65, shoe_size=6, seed=3)
```

> **_NOTE_:** To enable training mode, one `CardCounter` or `BackCounter` instance is required to have `training=True`.

### Viewing Results

After running either mode, each playerâ€™s performance can be reviewed:

```python
print(back_counter.stats.summary(string=True))
```
